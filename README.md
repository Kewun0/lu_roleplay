This is a role play gamemode for [Liberty Unleashed](http://liberty-unleashed.co.uk)

Started on November 19th, 2017 as the United Islands project, the original scripters [Vortrex](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=2249) and [Aeoris](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=4407)
wanted to create a role play server with a unique and feature-rich gamemode.

After a couple weeks of scripting, Aeoris decided to leave the project to work on other servers of his own. Shortly afterward, Vortrex decided to release the script to the public, in the hopes that many people would use it for their own servers.

The project is still maintained by public contributions.
