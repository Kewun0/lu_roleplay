RP script for Liberty Unleashed

Started on November 19, 2016 by [Vortrex](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=2249) and [Aeoris](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=4407) under the project name "United Islands RPG" with the intention of creating a quality RPG server for [Liberty Unleashed](http://liberty-unleashed.co.uk/).

[Aeoris](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=4407) left the project on November 29, 2016 ... Leaving [Vortrex](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=2249) as the sole scripter for the project.

In December 2016, [Vortrex](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=2249) decided to provide the source via a public repository so anybody could create an RPG server with it. It was previously in a different repository, but has officially moved to it's new home [here](https://github.com/VortrexFTW/lu_roleplay). Anybody is welcome to provide contributions. For more information, send [Vortrex](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/index.php?action=profile;u=2249) a message on the [LU forum](http://forum.liberty-unleashed.co.uk/). You can also submit issues on the project's [issues page](https://github.com/VortrexFTW/lu_roleplay/issues).
